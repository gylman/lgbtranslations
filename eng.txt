Wow! You finished the last level, great!
Would you like to move on to *"{nextLevel}"*, the next level?
Awesome! You matched or exceeded our solution.
See if you can whittle it down to {best} :D
Warning! Mercurial does aggressive garbage collection and thus needs to prune your tree
The -A option is not needed for this app, just commit away!
There is no status command for this app, since there is no staging of files. Try hg summary instead
I need the option {option} for that command!
hg log without -f is currently not supported, use -f
Detached head!
On branch {branch}
Ready to commit! (as always in this demo)
Quick commit. Go Bears!
Already up to date!
Your origin branch is out of sync with the remote branch and fetch cannot be performed
The remote repository has diverged from your local repository, so uploading your changes is not a simple fast forward (and thus your push was rejected). Please pull down the new changes in the remote repository, incorporate them into this branch, and try again. You can do so with git pull or git pull --rebase
You cannot execute that command on a remote branch
An origin is required for that command
An origin already exists! You cannot make a new one
You can't delete the master branch, the branch you are on, or things that aren't branches
Merge {target} into {current}
No commits to rebase! Everything is a merge commit or changes already applied
Nothing to do...
Fast forwarding...
Branch already up-to-date
The ref {ref} does not exist or is unknown
Commit {commit} does not have a {match}
Warning!! Detached HEAD state
No need to add files in this demo
Those options you specified are incompatible or incorrect
The commit {commit} already exists in your changes set, aborting!
Can't reset in detached head! Use checkout if you want to move
The default behavior for resets on LearnGitBranching is a --hard, so feel free to omit that option if you get tired of typing it out in our lessons. Just remember that the default behavior on actual Git is --mixed.
There is no concept of adding / staging files, so that option or command is invalid!
Reverting {oldCommit}: {oldMsg}
I expect at most {upper} argument(s) for {what}
I expect at least {lower} argument(s) for {what}
That command accepts no general arguments
